## User's Guide
[The BB Match Reporting System](http://bb-mrs.herokuapp.com/) is a light-weight system that allows its users (Coaches) to create and list their teams, host contests, and report matches (TBA), and to see the the history of their teams (TBA). It is inspired by Game Workshop's [Blood Bowl](https://www.bloodbowl.com/), but can easily be adjusted for other use as well.

### View Teams and Contests
Even before logging in, you can view the list of current teams and contests, and their details. However, to do anything, you'll need an account, so click the Register link and get started.

### Registering an Account
You'll be prompted to give name (think this as your Coach name), username and password. **The passwords are NOT encrypted. Do NOT use a password you'd use anywhere else.** During account creation you can choose whether the account is coach or admin.

### Login
After creating your account, you are prompted to log in. Later on, use the Log in link.

### Creating a Team and Adding a Contest
After logging in as a coach, you have two new options, one to create a team, and another to add a new contest. Each of these have their own required fields, related to Blood Bowl. After creating a team or adding a contest, you can see them on the listing.

### Signing a Team up for a Contest
While logged in, you can click on the 'Sign me up' link under the contest details page (follow the link from contests list). Now you can choose the team you wish to sign up. (Currently all teams are listed, eventually you can only choose from your own ones.) After you sign the team up, it'll be listed in the contest. Each team can join any amount of contests.

### Reporting Matches (TBA)
This feature is yet to be added.

### Admin Mode
When logged in as admin, you can delete teams, contests, and by accessing the admin-only Account Management, even complete accounts. Note that deleting an account will cause all its teams and contests to be deleted as well.

### TBA:
- Team page with statistics
- Coach page with statistics
